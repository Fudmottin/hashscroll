# hashscroll
Creates a scrolling video clip of SHA-256 digests

This bash script was created on MacOS. The Homebrew package manager was used to install
the following dependencies:

- ImageMagick
- ffmpeg

They do all the real work. The hexdata.txt file was creted by modifying my sha-256 hash code.
You will also probably have to change the font path since I used a specific MacOS font.
